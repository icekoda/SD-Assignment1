What we hoped to create was a drink cration factory and implement an abstract factory pattern to our desgin. After using methods to create the users drink we then added prices to each set using a factory method pattern. 

In the following files posted you will be able to see our UML diagram screen capture for the following code. Along side the list of drinks and the prices it has been set as.
As well there are some of our Methods listed and the code inside. There is also a file with the output of the finial results and our test code. 

If there are any questions please be free to ask.
